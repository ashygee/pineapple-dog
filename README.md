Looks like you've elected to help care for Calvin, the Pineapple Dog™️! In this repo you'll find all of the information you need to best take care of him as well as some extra knowldege for knowing when he's being a little shit...zhu. 

## About Calvin
Calvin is a 9 year old half shih tzu/half terrier (shittier) bundle of joy. He likes smelling everything, sitting on laps, cuddling, being held like a baby, playing with stuffed animals, and doing nightly zoomies. His veterinarian is Dr. Vanessa Reeves at [Arguello Pet Hospital](http://www.arguellopet.com/). 

### Health
- He _does not_ have any known allergies
- He _does_ have a slight heart murmur. This has never affected him daily.

## Care routine
Caring for Calvin is fairly simple. Walks, food, and snuggles.

### Walks
Calvin doesn't have a strict schedule. His day tends to look something like this:
- (7am - 9am) Morning walk
- (after 12pm) Afternoon walk (optional)
- (8pm - 10pm) Evening walk before bed

The times aren't specific but more of a range for when he usually is out. There is no definite length of time that you should be out. Generally his morning walk is the longest (around 30min) and any extra walks later is usually just to go around the block a bit to stretch his legs and go to the bathroom.

**Morning walk**
It's not a requirement that he is out for 30min in the morning. A good rule of thumb for the morning walk is if he poops you're pretty good. Sometimes he may poop 2-3 times if you do take an extended walk, so be sure to pack lots of poop bags!

**Evening walk**
For the evening walk I recommend that you can be done after he pees twice. 

### Feeding
Food can be left out for Calvin to eat.

Calvin is picky and will eat when is hungry. I have tried for years to get him on a normal feeding schedule but he usually looks at me and then walks away. If you notice he isn't eating, it's because he wants an audience. He can be a bit of a diva and honestly likes to make sure there is a witness to him eating. This isn't always required but if it feels like he isn't eating, stand next to him and encourage him to eat. This generally works. Or pretending to put in a "sauce". My dog is adorabe but not the brightest. 

**What and how much?**
Calvin gets a bowl full of [dry food](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/natural-balance-small-breed-bites-lid-limited-ingredient-diets-grain-free-potato-and-duck-formula-dry-dog-food) in the morning and in the evening. Water whenever the bowl is empty. At bedtime I also typically leave a small cup of water for him to drink during the night.
